I'm re-doing this site.  I thought that I was going to use WordPress but this
server is a little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">VPS</a>
from SliceHost (RackSpace) and pages were loading too
slow.  So now I'm trying to do static site generation.

I am getting a <a href="./blog">blog</a> in place.  It's using the code from
my <a href="https://github.com/demian0311/pagin8">pagin8 project on github</a>.  
It's far from fully functionaly but I'm dog-fooding it early to get
me motivated.

And here's me on the Internet.

   <li>Pictures up on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/neidetcher">flickr</a>
   <li>What I'm thinking is at <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/demian0311">twitter</a>
   <li>The links I keep around are on <a href="http://www.delicious.com/demian0311">delicious</a>
   <li>My professional profile with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/demian0311">LinkedIn</a>
   <li>Some of my code is hosted by <a href="https://github.com/demian0311">github</a>
</ul>

Most importantly, here's <a href="resume.html">my resume</a>.
