<h1>@[DLN]</h1>
I'm re-doing this site.  I thought that I was going to use WordPress but this
server is a little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">VPS</a>
from SliceHost (RackSpace) and pages were loading too
slow.  So now I'm trying to do static site generation.
<p>
Most of the current static site generation tools suffer from 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH</a> issues so 
I'm rolling my own.  In the very near future I'll snap out of it and realize
that creating yet another static site generation tool is not in my best
interest.  For now, the fact that I'm attempting to roll my own is the reason 
why this site isn't all full of features.
<p>
Most importantly, here's <a href="resume.html">my resume</a>.

And here's me on the Internet.
