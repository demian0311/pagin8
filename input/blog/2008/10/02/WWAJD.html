<p>What would Andrew Jackson do?  If we're asking how to treat native Americans then we probably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears">don't want to know</a>.  If we're talking about centralized banks (the fore-runners of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System">Federal Reserve</a>) then he's got some prescient points.  This is a quote of him while he was jumping up and down on the grave of the 2nd centralized bank he killed.<br /><blockquote>Gentlemen, I have had men watching you for a long time and I am convinced that you have used the funds of the bank to speculate in the breadstuffs of the country. <span style="font-weight: bold;">When you won, you divided the profits amongst you, and when you lost, you charged it to the bank. You tell me that if I take the deposits from the bank and annul its charter, I shall ruin ten thousand families.</span> That may be true, gentlemen, but that is your sin! Should I let you go on, you will ruin fifty thousand families, and that would be my sin! You are a den of vipers and thieves . . . I intend to rout you out, and by the Eternal God I will rout you out!<br />    ~ President Andrew Jackson, 1836<br /></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Shamelessly lifted from </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://blog.nationbuilder.org/2008/10/andrew-jackson-to-banksters-by-eternal.html">Nation Builder</a><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p>
