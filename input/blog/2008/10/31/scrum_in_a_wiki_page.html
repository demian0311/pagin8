At my job we have been doing scrum successfully.  I've read 2 books on scrum and I've done it at a previous job.  It's great, times would have to be very tough before I work on a project that does not leverage <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">agile</a>.<br /><br />We manage our scrum process on 1 wiki page.  I know I'm not going to impress anyone, it's crazy but it works.  Previously I've used <a href="http://xplanner.org/">XPlanner</a>, after that I used <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">Jira</a>.  I hear good things about ScrumWorks, Rally seems too heavy and tabular.  We only have 3 coders including me.  For burn-down charts I fire up a spread-sheet.  We needed it online because, understandably, the product owner wants to add to the backlog and re-order stories without physically being at one location.<br /><br />Here's how it looks...<br /><pre>== sprint x ==<br /><br />=== to do ===<br />- (1) as a user<br />- (1) as a user<br /><br />=== doing ===<br />- (1) as a user<br /><br />=== done ===<br />- (1) as a user<br />- (1) as a user<br /><br />== backlog ==<br />- (1) as a user<br />- (1) as a user<br />- as a user<br /></pre><ul><li>The product owner adds stories to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">backlog</span> and sorts them there (most important stories are on top)<br /></li><li>The team moves stories for a sprint to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">to do</span> section of the current sprint</li><li>As we start working on tasks they go to <span style="font-weight: bold;">doing</span></li><li>When tasks are done they go to <span style="font-weight: bold;">done</span> of course</li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why this is good</span><br />It's simple.  It's web-based.  It works.  You can diff the wiki-page to see who edited what and when.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why this is bad</span><br />You can't automatically do anything with the data.  You can't push a button and get reports.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Still scratching the itch</span><br />I've been thinking about doing a simple scrum tool for over a year now.  With my hamster-on-crack attention span I don't have much to show.  The current incarnation is Hibernate, Struts2 and lots of Spring.  Stay tuned.
