<p>With the current events in Mumbai Indian officials and pundits are saying how the perpetrators must have nation-state training, resources and preparation.  They certainly may have but it's important to understand this isn't necessary.<br /><br />In the DC sniper situation I remember talking-heads saying that the sniper must have been special forces.  They even speculated Russian or American special forces because not many nations have such an <span style="font-style: italic;">advanced</span> sniper program. <br /><br />I believe the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/metro/daily/oct02/snipershootings.htm">DC sniper case</a> didn't involve any shots that were over 200 yards (2 football fields).  All of these shots were done in the prone position (laying on your stomach) which affords you the most accuracy.<br /><br />Of course the real criminals were a mediocre soldier who wasn't even an infantryman and a teenager.  I don't have any inside knowledge of the Mumbai terrorists but they aren't necessarily sponsored by a national intelligence service or sanctioned by the state of Pakistan.  I think it's highly likely that they came out of the fertile terrorist swamp-land that is Pakistan.  They needed motivation, a dozen guns, transportation and a little bit of intelligence to accomplish what they did.  Let's say less than $100,000.<br /><br />It's sort of like when you <span style="font-style: italic;">come to</span> with missing teeth and a sore gut.  Your first conclusion is probably something like 'that guy must be a kung-fu ninja master'.  It's comforting to think that it's unlikely that these events can occur.  The reality is that most anyone who is properly motivated can unleash violence on anyone they would like in any city in the world.</p>
