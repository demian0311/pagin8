We have an old iPod around that is fried so I thought it'd be a fun thing to shoot at.<br /><br />Sure there's good training value to be had by shooting at paper targets but once in a while it's fun to take the boom stick to something else.  Electronics are always a good choice.<br /><br />Besides the damage pictured the battery was particularly hot.  I assume some magic contents were touching that weren't meant to touch and the battery was discharging or something.<br /><br />Indeed a .45 ACP round fired from my Kimber Custom 1911A1 clone goes right through an iPod.  Good times.<br clear="all" /></p>
