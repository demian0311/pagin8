I thought I'd shoot up what our current stack is.  I'm always interested to hear what others are working with so here's me.<br /><br /><ul><li>Development OS: Ubuntu, Mac OS, Windows.  We're 100% agnostic as long as you can use Java6.</li><li>Deployment OS: CentOS.  Has better management capabilities.</li><li>Servlet Container: Tomcat.  We also do some development in Jetty because it's so easy to use with Maven but we have run into a couple.  We can't assume anything that works in Jetty will work in Tomcat and vice-versa.</li><li>Database: MySQL.  Incredibly easy to develop with, light weight.  It has held up great in production.</li><li>Persistence: iBatis.  Happy with the iBatis choice.  It's easy to add new queries and tweak the SQL.  It's a great tool, gets out of your way.</li><li>Dependency Injection: We're big Spring fans.</li><li>MVC framework: Struts2.  I'd like to see more progress and adoption in that project but we're still happy with the decision.</li></ul>
