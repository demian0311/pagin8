As a country we seem to be unable to think something without forcing that opinion on everyone else.  I don't think Eliot Spitzer should be prosecuted for using prostitutes.  I don't think it should be against the law.  But as someone that uses prostitutes has he supported legalization?  Indeed as attorney general of New York state he has gone after prostitution rings.<br /><br />Are we a nation of people that think this stuff shouldn't be illegal but we're all just saying it should so that we placate some imaginary conservative old people? <br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">I think</span> wearing seatbelts is the right thing to do therefore <span style="font-weight: bold;">everyone should</span> wear seatbelts.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">I think</span> prostitution is wrong therefore <span style="font-weight: bold;">everyone should</span> not use prostitutes.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">I think</span> gambling is wrong therefore <span style="font-weight: bold;">everyone should</span> refrain from gambling.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">I think</span> smoking pot is wrong therefore <span style="font-weight: bold;">everyone should</span> be prohibited from smoking pot.</li></ul>Why does the <span style="font-weight: bold;">everyone should</span> always have to follow the <span style="font-weight: bold;">I think</span>?  I wish it were a virtue to not impose our will on others.  I'm not sure how we can go back to that direction peacefully.  The tendency in organizations is to hoard power.  Law-makers create laws, it's what they do.  How do we wipe the slate clean again?<br />~~~<blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>I believe that every individual is naturally entitled to do as he pleases with himself and the fruits of his labor, so far as it in no way interferes with any other men's rights.<i><br />Abraham Lincoln</i><i></i></blockquote></p>
