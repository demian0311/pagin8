<p>I was reading this:<br /><a href="http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/060105_soviet_lessons.shtml">http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/060105_soviet_lessons.shtml</a><br /><br />The first part of the article is similar to my previous post.  The thought is that there will be war over resources, ironically that war would largely squander those resources.  That's true with a conventional war.  Where we move our military to capture and retain real estate.<br /><br />This brings up the issue as to what kind of warfare would not squander oil?  Nuclear war of course.  We have Nukes sitting in silos, in flight and on submarines just waiting to be used.  What better way to eliminate a fossil fuel competitor than to unload your nuclear weapons on them.<br /><br />We've painted ourselves into a corner, it'll be interesting to see how we get out.</p>
