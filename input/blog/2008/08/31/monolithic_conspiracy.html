<p>In an open society secrecy is bad.  We should not put up with secret societies that have secret oaths and proceedings.  The dangers of excessive concealment outweighs the dangers of free access to information.<br /><br />The survival of America is pointless if it means we forget our traditions, what makes us Americans.<br /><br />There's a real danger that the powers that be announce the need for more security so that they can expand sexurity and censorship.<br /><br />Globally, we are opposed by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy.  It relies on greed to expand influence.  It inserts itself into institutions, it uses subversion instead of democracy, it intimidates.<br /><br />This conspiracy has wealth and people that work in concert.  Their influence reaches into military, diplomatic, economic, scientific and political operations.  The plans are private and the dissenters are silenced.<br /><br />I ask your help in alerting Americans.<br /><br /><hr /><br />Sound crazy?  To give credit, that was just me paraphrasing a JFK speech given in April 27, 1961.  Interesting stuff, there's a good chance he's just talking about the commies.  Maybe I'm paraphrasing bad.   Judge for yourself, the link has the full text to the speech and audio.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Reference+Desk/Speeches/JFK/003POF03NewspaperPublishers04271961.htm">http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Reference+Desk/Speeches/JFK/003POF03NewspaperPublishers04271961.htm</a></p>
