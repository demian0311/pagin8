<p>It's interesting with blogs.  If someone isn't blogging either you know they're not up to anything (okay well you don't <span style="font-style: italic;">need</span> to be doing anything interesting to blog about it) or you know they're incredibly busy.  I've been busy.<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago I got pulled into the office of my CEO and was informed that they were having trouble getting funding and they had to cut some expenses.  They were very cordial and handled it well.  I'm a free market, <span style="font-style: italic;">eat the weak</span> type guy so in principle I don't disagree with the action.  Like a life boat, either everyone drowns or a few drown so the rest can go on.  I don't think I was the guy to offload but what are you going to do.  What else am I going to think, all computer programmers know they're the shit.<br /><br />Ironically I chose this permanent job instead of a contracting gig because I wanted a bit more security.  Security is an illusion.  But I already knew that after surviving 4 years of layoffs and seeing damn good people get walked out the door.<br /><br />So, the drive home.  What do you do.  What do you say to the wife holding the 4 month old baby.  In the 20 minute ride home I already phoned a couple friends to let them know I'm on the market.  The wife took everything well, she's very supportive, the greatest.  I think seeing that I was confident was helpful.  And I was confident but I was going to take the job hunt seriously.  Maybe that process is blogworthy, it's the basics... work every angle and network connection you can think of.<br /><br />Without going into the specifics of the search, the outcome is the realization that I have a great network of friends and co-workers that are helpful and respect my ability.  They came through, by the second day I had over a dozen leads from about 10 people.  I also feel great about my attitude, adversity is a chance to show you have character.<br /><br />In just <span style="font-style: italic;">minutes</span> shy of a week from being let go I had 2 great, solid job offers for more money than what I was making.  Sure it doesn't hurt that the job market rocks in Denver but still, it's great affirmation.</p>
