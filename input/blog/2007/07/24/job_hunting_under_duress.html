<p>All my readers (hi mom) know that recently I was on a job hunt.  And for the first time in my life I left a company not on my own terms.  So it was a crazy week, I was confident but I wanted to work hard to get a job lined up quickly.  I gotta say, more than patting myself on the back I think my success is largely due to a red hot job market in Denver.  Given that, here's how my stint in un-employment went.<br /><br />Before the job hunt there are things you're already doing to make a potential job hunt go smoothly.<br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keep the resume up to date</span>.  I have a resume on my computer under version control.  As soon as I do or learn something that is worth putting on the resume I add it.  My resume is always available at <a href="http://neidetcher.com/resume.html">http://neidetcher.com/resume.html</a> .<br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Get yourself out there</span>.  How Google-able are you?  Does it show you give any talks at user groups?  Does it show any of your writing on technology?  Or does it show you telling a Python noob to RTFM in 2002 (as my Google search results do).  Anyways your online presence is something to continually be aware of.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Maintain the network</span>.  IM is great for keeping in touch with friends and former co-workers.  Lunches are good too, keep those contacts alive with a diverse group of friends.  Use LinkedIn, I wish they were more open but whatever.<br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Don't be an asshole</span>.  It's a small world, in your domain (I'm mostly in Telecom), in your city (Denver).  I constantly run into people that know people I know.</li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">Day 0, Wednesday </span><br /><ul><li>4PM: The hammer falls.</li><li>5PM: On the drive home, make a couple phone calls to friends to get the word out.</li><li>6PM: Tell the wife, relax.  </li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">Day 1, Thursday</span><br /><ul><li>Send out an email to have a happy hour in your own honor.  Sure it's self serving but if there's any time to serve yourself now is it.</li><li>Let more of your network know that you're on the market.</li><li>I think by the end of the day I got a handful of leads from people I know.<br /></li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">Day 2, Friday</span><br /><ul><li>Now get that resume cleaned up.  You keep it up to date all the time but now give it all a real good look.  Maybe have a trusted friend review it for you.  Get your resume ready in HTML, PDF, Word (I'll put my principles on hold) and even text format.<br /></li><li>Update your <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> profile.  I'm morally opposed to soliciting recommendations on LinkedIn but if they fall in your lap make sure to thank the recommender.<br /></li><li>3PM: Happy hour, press the flesh, keep your chin up.  Get the word out.</li><li>Also work on a standard letter for job inquiries.  Not quite a cover letter but just some sentences announcing who you are and maybe a couple points about your background.<br /></li><li>As of Friday I got about another handful of leads.<br /></li></ul><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Day 3 & 4, the Weekend</span><br /><ul><li>No humans to talk to or call so <span style="font-style: italic;">now</span> is the time to assault the job boards. </li><li>Nothing gets the word out like updating your resume on <a href="http://www.monster.com/">monster.com</a>.  It's an ugly site, they put advertisements in your face but if you want recruiters to know you're on the market it's the site to go to.</li><li>There are lots of sites to go to but recently some job site aggregators have sprung into existence.  <a href="http://www.indeed.com/">indeed.com</a> and <a href="http://www.simplyhired.com/">simplyhired.com</a> both show listing from multiple sites.  So they are your 2 stop shop for seeing the maximum number of listings.  Since I've found a job another cool site, <a href="http://www.hound.com/">hound.com</a> has come around it aggregates <span style="font-style: italic;">employer</span> job boards.<br /></li><li>So yeah, assault the boards.  Put in some loose search criteria, <span style="font-style: italic;">java or j2ee or python</span> is what I typically use.</li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">Day 5, Monday</span><br /><ul><li>Okay, the flood gates are open.</li><li>I don't deal with Indian call centers.  It's not a racist thing, I respect Indian people I admire their tenacity, intelligence and ability to kick ass in whatever they set out to do.  But if I'm going to go through a recruiter it's going to be an American recruiter.  Granted, an American head hunter would probably sell an American programmer up the river without thinking twice but that's how I roll.<br /></li><li>Keep track of calls, I like emails better.  Keep the process moving go to the next steps.</li></ul><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Day 6, Tuesday</span><br />I had 2 interviews lined up.  The first one was going incredibly well so I blew off the second one.  The second one was with a recruiting mill downtown.  That's a crappy thing to do but you have to go with your gut.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Day 7, Wednesday</span><br />Sitting at Panera bread eating soup and taking advantage of the free wifi I get 2 offers by email.  They're both solid, great teams and more money than what I was making.  Okay, I can relax a little.  It turned out that both offers came from personal contacts.  Maintain that network young man.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Some thoughts after the dust settled</span><br /><ul><li>Going through all this was very affirming.  I have great friends that have enough confidence in me to put their own reputation on the line in recommending me for job leads, very cool.</li><li>I can't understand why companies have such long hiring cycles.  It stands to reason that the folks you probably want are more able to find jobs quickly.  So if you have a long hiring cycle you're just missing out on those people.  I kept getting responses from companies <span style="font-style: italic;">weeks</span> after I accepted an offer.  If I were running a shop I'd make sure to have the process down and I'd be ready to potentially get someone an offer within 3 days.</li><li>If an employer wants to stand out I think they should do something drastic.  Post on Dice or wherever under their own company name.  Don't use a head-hunter.  Listings with head-hunters just merge<br /></li></ul></p>
