<p>In the continuing series on technologies I don't have a ton of experience on but feel compelled to blog about, Let's talk about <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>.  I've had an interesting relationship with Maven over the past few years.  I knew lots of smart people use it, I knew there was something I didn't get.  So every 6 months I tried to give it a shot and every 6 months it kicked my ass.  Every error message Maven would display I would interpret it as, "you're screwed, if you were using Ant at least you'd have a chance in hell of figuring out the problem."<br /><br />Once again I'm starting some greenfield work and I figured, now is the time to give it another shot.  This time I stuck with it.  Coming into Maven it really amounts to a few hours of absolute confusion and frustration.  After that hump you see the elegance and the power of what it can do for you.<br /><br />I had reservations about Maven.  What happens when you are deploying a critical fix to production and you have to build but Maven is unable to find some obscure transitive dependency that you don't have in version control.  Well Maven keeps around a local cache (~/.m2/repository) so if you've built your system already and you haven't introduced a new dependency then you're fine.  If for some reason all the Maven dependency magic breaks down you can manually add a jar to your local repository.  I had to do it, it's lame, not intuitive but whatever.<br /><br />Another solution to this is setting up a <span style="font-weight: bold;">local repository</span> for your company.  That way your version control system isn't full of jars and you can control your repository.  The repository just amounts to a <a href="http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/maven2/org/springframework/spring-ibatis/2.0.6/">directory structure available by HTTP</a>.  I just tossed my local cache behind Apache and presto, I have a local Maven repository.  So nukes can hit every web server outside of Denver and I can still do a fresh build of my projects on a clean box.<br /><br />Here are some general points for why I think Maven is better than Ant<br /><ul><li>You describe your project, you don't tell the tool how to do mundane things</li><li>You don't version control dependencies, you tell Maven what you need and where it can look for it.</li><li>Like with any open source tool with a thriving community, lots of smart people are focusing on improving and adding to it.</li></ul>Here's specific stuff Maven buys you:<br /><ul><li>Generates a site for your project with all the information you'd typically want to have available for developers and users of your software. mvn site</li><li>The site also includes nice reporting, jUnit, Cobertura code coverage, PMD, Checkstyle, HTML cross reference of your code, JavaDocs.</li><li>Run unit tests.  mvn test</li><li>Package your application as a war or jar. mvn package</li><li>Create an Eclipse project from your code. mvn eclipse:eclipse</li></ul>If you have enough time for a few hours to get past the confusion then give Maven a try.  I don't plan on looking back to Ant unless I have to.</p>
