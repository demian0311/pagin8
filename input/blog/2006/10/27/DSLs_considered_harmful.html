<p>First off, I reserve the right to change my mind.  My experience of actual DSL work could fit in a thimble, but that doesn't stop a red-blooded American from having an opinion.<br /><br />The concept of DSL (Domain Specific Languages) is getting a lot of attention.<ul><br /><li><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/InternalDslStyle.html">Martin Fowler</a><br /><li><a href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com">Venkat Subramaniam </a><br /><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_specific_languages">Wikipedia background info on DSL</a><br /></ul>Some of the buzz mentions Ruby.  Ruby has some features about it that can make APIs look like part of the language.  So where you would normally expect your language keywords to be sprinkled about you would see domain specific things naked in the breeze without a set of parentheses in sight.<br /><br />Some of the luminaries that talk about DSL (both smart guys that I've seen in person and am really impressed with) think that it's neat that this thing that doesn't look at all like a programming language we know really compiles.<br /><br />I don't think it's cool at all.  When I saw things like this when I was giving Ruby a chance it made me stop and scratch my head, "Where the hell did this come from?"<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Bold prediction: I don't think DSLs will go very far</span>, I think we'll flirt with the idea but eventually come to the conclusion that they just sorta make programming more difficult to get.  Currently you get familiar with a language and then you start pulling in APIs to get the job done.  With DSLs I bet context switching to different domains would be a lot more clumsy on the mind.  Maybe this is just a reflection of how little I trust my own brain to keep stuff straight.</p>
