<p>Okay, even tho I chose that title, I'm not sure if there'll be a Java -> Rails II but I'm going to be positive.  Things are going good so far.<br /><br />Here's my initial assesment.  After doing some cumbersome setup (zero compared to the J2EE world) I was able to quickly put up a few pages relating to domain entities.  The magic in this is the scaffolding capability.  It uses a pattern that naturally falls out of web development; a full-list, detail-view, edit, delete type capability.  There must be some fancy name for that I'm sure.<br /><br />It took me a bit to re-learn all the mysql stuff you have to do for creating a new user, password, database, etc.  I wish they wouldn't use the 'root' user name to mean their DB admin.  Oh well.<br /><br />As I'm doing Rails of course I'm learning Ruby.  It's a little strange and cumbersome right now but I'll give it a chance.  I wonder if Python is the same way for people just picking it up.  I really think it isn't.  I remember working with Python and so often it just works the way you think it should.  Perhaps my memory timeline is off and those were memories after using Python for a year or so.<br /><br />Incidentally I'm reading 2 books while going thru this process.  "Programming Ruby" by Thomas & Hunt and "Agile Web Development with Rails" by Thomas and Heinemeier.  The books seem good enough.</p>
