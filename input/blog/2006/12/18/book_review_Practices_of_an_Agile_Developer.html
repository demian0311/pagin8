<p>Like <i>My Job Went to India</i> I see this book as being a continuation of the original <i>Pragmatic Programmer</i> book.  I'd say if you aren't well read on XP, Scrum and the books mentioned above you could probably skip Practices of an Agile Developer.<br /><br />The book is great tho.  Like I've said about Venkat (the author), if you ever want to feel like you have no business coding go watch Venkat.<br /><br />They coin the term <i>resume driven design</i>  I've seen that before and man it pisses me off.  When I see people doing that I'd just as well see that project go off shore, worst case they'd make stupid decisions more cheaply.<br /><br />They talk about integrating early.  Generally this is good but the book doesn't talk about the flip side.  I'm thinking of a situation I was in a few months ago where I was basically debugging code that I didn't own over the Atlantic.  I think code from different teams should be delivered as jar files and should be at a high level of stability and correctness.<br /><br />The book does have a good discussion on exceptions.  They go through balancing giving users helpful, simple information and giving developers and support folks enough detail to solve the problem.<br /><br />Finally, it's a great book but you could skip it if you're already a junkie for other Pragmatic Programmer books and you know your stuff when it comes to agile processes.</p>
