<p><a href="http://www.turnofthecrank.com/2006/12/01/the-5-books-that-every-programmer-should-read/">Here's a darn good list of the 5 books every programmer should read</a>.  For convenience, here's the list.<br /><ol><br /><li>Code Complete by McConnell<br /><li>The Pragmatic Programmer by Hunt & Thomas<br /><li>Applying UML and Patterns by Larman<br /><li>Design Patterns by GOF<br /><li>Refactoring by Fowler<br /></ol><br />This is one of those cases where I read something and I say the author is brilliant but really I dig it so much because he agrees with me.  These truly are good candidates for the five most important books for a programmer to read.<br /><br />It has been a long time since I read Code Complete.  As I recall it had lots of C code in it.  It was still a great read.  Of all of the books I'm not sure this one should be here.  Maybe I'm getting it confused with <i>Writing Solid Code</i>, another Microsoft book on writing software.<br /><br />If you liked the Pragmatic Programmer book you should read <a href="http://demian0311.blogspot.com/2006/03/book-review-my-job-went-to-india.html">My Job Went to India</a>.  It's a great continuation to the book with outsourcing as some additional motivation.<br /><br />The Larman book, Applying UML and Patterns is another good one too.  If I had to pick one book, this might be the one.  It shows how to apply UML to design and it makes sense of process.<br /><br />Design Patterns is essential but can be dangerous.  Many programmers have showed up to work Monday morning with a skip in their step aching for a chance to apply the most recent design pattern they learned no matter how contrived the situation is.<br /><br />Refactoring by Fowler is great because it gives you an opportunity to peek over the shoulder of Martin Fowler to see how he slings code at a very low level.  How often he runs tests and how he moves code around.  The Computer Science program I went through didn't give us any idea how to develop software at a low level.  I wish I had this book when I first started.<br /><br />Beyond that list, if you're doing Java, Effective Java by Joshua Bloch should never be too far.  It's a great reference to keep around even after you've read it.  It was a good book to read in the sense that if you're going to be writing an API you'd better get your sh*t together.<br /><br />I'd replace Code Complete with Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, also by Martin Fowler.  It's a great language-agnostic book that has had lots of influence.  The Rails guys directly lifted Fowlers Active Record pattern.<br /><br />In the comments to that blog posting a lot of people mention the Mythical Man Month.  I'm ashamed to admit that I've never read it.  I've read summaries and the main points and I <i>kinda</i> think I get the gist.  A lot of the book seems intuitive.<br /><br />In a top 5 list now days I'd like to see a book devoted to an agile methodology.  The Schweiber book on Scrum would be good.  Maybe XP Explained.<br /><br />And why aren't there any Learn X in 10 Days books?</p>
