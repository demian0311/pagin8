<p>Here's a thesis: <span style="font-weight:bold;">software engineers are the stem cells of business</span>.  Colleagues and I were talking over BBQ today and came to that conclusion (surprise, we're all software engineers).<br /><br />I have a bachelors of science in computer science.  I have been involved in sales, management, recruiting, marketing, graphic arts, tech writing, testing and of course development.  Because of my education I don't think I'm uniquely qualified to do any of those roles (besides programming of course).<br /><br />So how come (in a pinch) developers can fill other roles and not vice versa?  Well, I think developers are smart.  They also know a lot about whatever business they're in; they have to.  They enjoy learning and can pick new disciplines and concepts up quickly.  It also helps that software engineering is a very black art to the un-initiated.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, without other roles like sales and marketing I'd be slinging code in my moms basement after a full day at 7-Eleven.  We need sales and business types.</p>
