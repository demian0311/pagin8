<p>Rick, A former co-worker likes to come up with top 10 lists for noteworthy events.  At my good-bye lunch he read this list.  I'm omitting last names to protect the innocent.  It's full of inside jokes as well, apologies.<br /><br />10) Rumor has it they don't care if employees bring guns to work.<br />9) They use CVS<br />8) Scott S. works just down the road.  Coincidence?  Think about it.<br />7) His boss is Indian, his boss's boss is a Greek, he works with a bunch of Irish folks - goddamnit, he wants to work with Amurikans!<br />6) He's hoping Steve J. works there.<br />5) He's tired of working with and for a bunch of left leaning commies.<br />4) Now that he's married and having a kid, he figures it's time to settle down and work at a stable place with a guaranteed future.<br />3) Ken keeps getting all the good jobs.<br />2) You mean it's not Logic<i>Blaze</i>?<br />1) Who was that [Demian] again?<br /><br />And there you have it.  Thanks Rick.</p>
