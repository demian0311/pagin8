I started doing the 5/3/1 routine.  I didn't like that he didn't have a pulling motion be
one of the main lifts.  So I modified it to include the clean & jerk.  I was wrong about
this.  For most of the stuff you do in life it's a good idea to look for the experts in
whatever persuit you're interested in.  Jim Wendler is well respected when it comes to
programming for weight lifters and power athletes.

Wendler has you doing pull-ups between every pushing set.  I just finished the 2nd strict
cycle of 5/3/1 doing his exercises exactly and the pull-ups.  I like the results, although
I am not measuring my 1 rep max for pull-ups I can tell it's getting easier.

I guess the point is, don't be an ass-clown like me.  Listen to guys that know their stuff.
