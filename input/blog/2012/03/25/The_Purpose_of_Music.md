Back in the Napster and gnutella days I built up a ton of music.  Somehow I lost it all.
That is one of the main reasons why so much of what I have now is in the
cloud.  My images are on flickr, books are in dropbox, source code is on 
github and so on.

Music used to fill all the margins.  All the dead time like driving and
public transportation.  That has changed since podcasts.  If I have some
down time and it is not practical to read then I will listen to a podcast.

I would rather learn about an interesting topic than listen to music.

But music still serves a purpose.  I use it almost exclusively for two things 
now.  To exercise (lift weights usually) and write software.   


## Exercise
When I exercise I want music to pump me up.  It changes all the time but
right now these are the artists that get me into a workout.

- Black Label Society
- AC/DC
- Arcade Fire
- Placebo
- Skrillex
- NIN

## Writing Software
When I write software a lot of the times I do not listen to music but when
I do it has to be something that is not distracting.  The vocals are less
distinct, absent or better yet in another language.  [Pandora](http://pandora.com/) 
does a great job finding non-distracting music based on my preferences.

- Sigur Ros
- Radio Head
