This past week I started training Muay Thai at 303 Training Center.


I trained martial arts about a year ago before I got injured.  Back
then it was a mix of standup, grappling and close quarters combatives
(the kind of stuff police and military train).  Training in a few
things at once made it impossible (for me at least) to get good at
anything.  So I decided that I would focus on something.


The professor of the program is Duane Ludwig.  He has the fastest
knockout in UFC history.  So far it is a lot of fun.  It's a great
workout.  I feel like a gimp right now though.  My brain doesn't 
work fast enough to put combinations together quickly right now.
