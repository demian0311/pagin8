I've been getting good results from lifting.  Here is what I'm currently doing.

## Nutrition
I follow the paleo / primal diet.  Primal is probably the better term because I'm
not shy about getting a little dairy.

I have never been diagnosed with gluten intolerance but I can say for myself 
that I haven't been sick since I've been on the paleo diet.  
Arthritis runs in my family, I was starting to get some sharp 
pain in my fingers.  This has gone away since starting paleo.

The diet offers good protein and good satiety.  The diet does not have to be low
carbohydrate but if you do go lower carb on the diet you may notice benefits. 
About 3 weeks in I went thru about a week of feeling foggy.  People have described
this carb-flu as feeling outside of your head.  This is a good description.  This is
your body going into mode of using fat for energy more than glucose.  

When you come
out the other side you'll notice that you can skip meals without experiencing huge
blood sugar fluctuations.  This comes in handy when you end up in situations without
good food options.  Since then I believe that I think and function better.   I 
occasionally fast for a day, there are supposed benefits but I think it's good to
prove to yourself that you can do it.

I'm more liberal with carb intake after workouts.  Milk, sweet potatoes, bananas, honey 
and fruit are good candidates for post-workout carbs.

There are many interpretations for how to do paleo / primal, here are some of the 
higher level points that work for me:

* No gluten ever
* Lots of vegetables (especially green and leafy), meat and good fat
* Minimal dairy, legumes, rice and corn
* As little sugar as possible
* Get some organ meat occasionally

Even though I have referred to it as a diet it is not a diet.  You cannot un-learn
the things you find out by going through it.  You feel better and when you fall off
the wagon you'll regret feeling like crap from eating processed food.  Paleo is just
the way everyone should eat, it's not a diet.

Here are some paleo / primal jumping off points.

## Supplementation
The Paleo folks don't encourage supplementation besides vitamin D but I supplement 
anyways.  

### Protein
Protein is what your body uses to make muscles.  You won't have organ damage by 
supplementing with protein.  The studies that everyone refers to dealt with people
that already had liver damage using ungodly amounts of protein.  There are
recommendations to calculate how much protein you should get but I don't pay 
that close attention.

#### Whey
I take whey protein immediately after workouts with whole milk.  Other than this 
I don't drink milk.  Sometimes I'll also have whey protein with water some time 
during the day.  Getting the extra protein depends on how much I think I've earned
the protein.  Whey protein digests quickly that's why you take it right after 
working out.   

#### Cassein
I also take a protein blend that primarily has cassein protein right before going 
to bed.  Cassein protein digests slowly, that's why you take it at night. 

### Creatine
I go on creatine for 3 weeks and then take a week off (coordinating with the deload
week of 5/3/1).  Creatine occurs in meat but you wouldn't get enough from a regular
diet.  It has been shown to improve cognitive and physical ability. 

You will find that you can more easily get out the last few reps on creatine where
you would otherwise struggle.  Creatine also slightly plumps up the muscles, cell 
volumizing is the term.  Besides just looking like you are bigger I think this is
creatine effecting the energy systems for your muscles; co-locating more fuel next
to the muscles so it's ready when you need it.  Like when you're lifting heavy for
a good number of reps.

### Vitamins
* Vitamin D
* Vitmain C at another time of day besides when I took the multi-vitmain
* Multi-vitamin

### Pre-workout
There are a variety of pre-workout supplements.  These usually have a half-dose of
creatine in them.  They might also have caffeine, vitamin-B, stuff like that.  This
is to get you pumped before a workout.  I always alternate between different
pre-workout supplements when I finish a container.  I think the blends might lose 
their effect so I alternate.  I do not use pre-workout supplements during the 
deload week of 5/3/1.

## Lifting
### Bro-science
Up until about 2 years ago my lifting was undisciplined and basically un-scientific. 
Maybe I would do exercises I picked up from magazines and ridiculous routines from 
bodybuilding magazines.

### A different way of lifting
It's worth noting that the type of weight lifting I recommend is different than what
you find in bodybuilding magazines.  Bodybuilders have gone through years of packing
on muscles with the help of drugs.  By the time they get to sharing their routines 
they are doing insane workouts that no person would be able to do like 2 workouts
a day for 6 days a week.  They also have goals that are different than most people.
They might be trying to perfect the double-peak on their bicep or get symmetry 
between their calves and their forearms.

You have to get real with yourself, your body composition goals can probably be
distilled into two things.

* less fat
* more muscle

You lose fat primarily with nutrition.   If you want to gain a little muscle or a 
lot there is an optimal way to do it.  You shouldn't spend time away from family
or other interests training in a way that doesn't optimize your efforts.  That 
optimal way of gaining muscle is what I do.

I want a body [capable of fighting bears on a mountain](http://s3.amazonaws.com/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_l4t05jbVJQ1qzfebyo1_1280.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAI6WLSGT7Y3ET7ADQ&Expires=1338605748&Signature=01M5o8S4UotTC4TGPqYHLxmFkM8%3D).  This means functional 
strength.  If I don't have a core that can stabilize my torso and protect my 
spine then I don't want the quadriceps to lift the weight.

### Getting a plan
I have found a lot of motivation and benefit from coming to the gym with a well 
thought out plan for what I'm going to do in a given workout.  

### Starting out with linear progression
Folks starting out have the benefit of progressing in a linear fashion.  

For starting out this should guide workouts.
* Workout 2-4 days a week
* Prefer multi-joint movements
* Prefer barbells over cables and dumbells
* Stick to the basics
* Increase volume (weight or reps) every week.  When you can no longer increase
weight in a linear fashion switch to an undulating periodization program like 5/3/1. 

A good linear progression program to start out with is
[Starting Strenth](http://www.amazon.com/Starting-Strength-3rd-Mark-Rippetoe/dp/0982522738/)
by Mark Rippetoe.  You don't need to read the entire book, searching for
[starting strength infographic](http://criticalmasspt.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/startingstrength.jpg) should pull up an image that sums up the program well.

Mark Rippetoe besides being humorously opinionated is also a great resource on how
to perform the basic lifts.  His book starting strength covers the basic lifts 
extensively but it's enough to hunt around for YouTube videos of him instructing 
how to do the basics.  He also sells a [DVD](http://aasgaardco.com/store/store.php?crn=210&rn=323&action=show_detail) 
full of him instructing the basic lifts to people of all dimensions.  I own it 
myself and have referred back to it several times.

### 5/3/1 and undulating periodization
You go to an undulating periodization program when you can no longer progress
in a linear fashion.  This might happen 6 months to a year into training.  

[Jim Wendler](http://www.jimwendler.com/) is a former football player, strenth coach 
and power lifter that came up with a simple program that is both regimented and flexible.  
That sounds contradictory but it's true and it makes 5/3/1 kind of awesome.

The best way to learn about 5/3/1 is his [ebook](http://www.jimwendler.com/2011/12/531-2nd-edition-ebook-now-for-sale/). 
The book is to the point and worth the price.

The basics of the plan focus on 4 main power movements.  

* overhead press
* deadlift
* bench
* squat

Each workout begins with one of these lifts.  The sets and reps for this first exercise
are prescribed according to percentages.  The remaining assistance work is meant to 
assist you in doing that first lift better.  For me the set and rep scheme has been
4 sets of 10 reps per exercise.

To manage my workouts I [use a spreadsheet](http://s3.amazonaws.com/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_l4t05jbVJQ1qzfebyo1_1280.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAI6WLSGT7Y3ET7ADQ&Expires=1338605748&Signature=01M5o8S4UotTC4TGPqYHLxmFkM8%3D) to calculate how much I should be lifting
on any given day.  I use Google docs, export a PDF and take that with me to the gym.
I later go back and record my workouts using the same spreadsheet.
